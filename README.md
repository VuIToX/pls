# searchesmia_removal
Here I put powershellscripts to remove the searchesmia extension

I created this GitHub Rep to just put my Powershell-Code for the removal of the searchesmia search engine extension in here so it may be found
and helps those who are lost with the issue since AdwCleaner or other antivirus companies can't seem to be arsed to integrate a removal tool for this.
So far I only have experience with the Google Chrome version, as this this was the one I got my hands on and reverse engineered it.
If anyone get their hands on the Mozilla Firefox oder MS Edge version, feel free to text me as I will make scripts for the removal of those too if the opportunity arises.
I hope atleast some will find them helpfull and if you find bugs or something in my code please leave a feedback.
